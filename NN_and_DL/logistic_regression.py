# Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset

# Welcome to your first (required) programming assignment! You will build a logistic regression classifier to recognize  cats. This assignment will step you through how to do this with a Neural Network mindset, and will also hone your intuitions about deep learning.

# - Do not use loops (for/while) in your code, unless the instructions explicitly ask you to do so.
# - Use `np.dot(X,Y)` to calculate dot products.

# - Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:
    # - Initializing parameters
    # - Calculating the cost function and its gradient
    # - Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent) 
# - Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.

## 1 - Packages ##

# First, let's run the cell below to import all the packages that you will need during this assignment. 
# - [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/1.20/) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
# - [h5py](http://www.h5py.org) is a common package to interact with a dataset that is stored on an H5 file.
# - [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) is a famous library to plot graphs in Python.
# - [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) are used here to test your model with your own picture at the end.

import numpy as np
import copy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import h5py
import scipy

from public_tests import *
## 2 - Overview of the Problem set ##

    # - a training set of m_train images labeled as cat (y=1) or non-cat (y=0)
    # - a test set of m_test images labeled as cat or non-cat
    # - each image is of shape (num_px, num_px, 3) where 3 is for the 3 channels (RGB). 
    # Thus, each image is square (height = num_px) and (width = num_px).

# You will build a simple image-recognition algorithm that can correctly classify pictures as cat or non-cat.

# Let's get more familiar with the dataset. Load the data by running the following code.


train_set_x_orig, train_set_y, test_set_x_orig, test_set_y, classes = load_dataset()

# We added "_orig" at the end of image datasets (train and test) because we are going to preprocess them. 
# After preprocessing, we will end up with train_set_x and test_set_x (the labels train_set_y and test_set_y don't need any preprocessing).

# Each line of your train_set_x_orig and test_set_x_orig is an array representing an image. You can visualize an example by running the following code. 
# Feel free also to change the `index` value and re-run to see other images. 

# Example of a picture
index = 60
plt.imshow(train_set_x_orig[index])
print ("y = " + str(train_set_y[:, index]) + ", it's a '" + classes[np.squeeze(train_set_y[:, index])].decode("utf-8") +  "' picture.")


# Many software bugs in deep learning come from having matrix/vector dimensions that don't fit. If you can keep your matrix/vector dimensions straight you will go a long way toward eliminating many bugs. 

### Exercise 1
# Find the values for:
    # - m_train (number of training examples)
    # - m_test (number of test examples)
    # - num_px (= height = width of a training image)
# Remember that `train_set_x_orig` is a numpy-array of shape (m_train, num_px, num_px, 3). 
# For instance, you can access `m_train` by writing `train_set_x_orig.shape[0]`.

m_train = train_set_x_orig.shape[0] 
m_test = test_set_x_orig.shape[0]
num_px = train_set_x_orig.shape[1]


print ("Number of training examples: m_train = " + str(m_train))
print ("Number of testing examples: m_test = " + str(m_test))
print ("Height/Width of each image: num_px = " + str(num_px))
print ("Each image is of size: (" + str(num_px) + ", " + str(num_px) + ", 3)")
print ("train_set_x shape: " + str(train_set_x_orig.shape))
print ("train_set_y shape: " + str(train_set_y.shape))
print ("test_set_x shape: " + str(test_set_x_orig.shape))
print ("test_set_y shape: " + str(test_set_y.shape))


# For convenience, you should now reshape images of shape (num_px, num_px, 3) 
# in a numpy-array of shape (num_px $*$ num_px $*$ 3, 1). After this, our training (and test) 
# dataset is a numpy-array where each column represents a flattened image. There should be m_train (respectively m_test) columns.

### Exercise 2
# Reshape the training and test data sets so that images of size (num_px, num_px, 3) are flattened into single vectors of shape 
# (num\_px $*$ num\_px $*$ 3, 1).

# A trick when you want to flatten a matrix X of shape (a,b,c,d) to a matrix X_flatten of shape (b$*$c$*$d, a) is to use: 
# X_flatten = X.reshape(X.shape[0], -1).T      # X.T is the transpose of X

# Reshape the training and test examples
#(â‰ˆ 2 lines of code)
train_set_x_flatten = train_set_x_orig.reshape(m_train,-1).T
test_set_x_flatten = test_set_x_orig.reshape(m_test,-1).T

# Check that the first 10 pixels of the second image are in the correct place
assert np.alltrue(train_set_x_flatten[0:10, 1] == [196, 192, 190, 193, 186, 182, 188, 179, 174, 213]), "Wrong solution. Use (X.shape[0], -1).T."
assert np.alltrue(test_set_x_flatten[0:10, 1] == [115, 110, 111, 137, 129, 129, 155, 146, 145, 159]), "Wrong solution. Use (X.shape[0], -1).T."

print ("train_set_x_flatten shape: " + str(train_set_x_flatten.shape))
print ("train_set_y shape: " + str(train_set_y.shape))
print ("test_set_x_flatten shape: " + str(test_set_x_flatten.shape))
print ("test_set_y shape: " + str(test_set_y.shape))


# To represent color images, the red, green and blue channels (RGB) must be specified for each pixel, 
# and so the pixel value is actually a vector of three numbers ranging from 0 to 255.
# 
# One common preprocessing step in machine learning is to center and standardize your dataset, 
# meaning that you substract the mean of the whole numpy array from each example, 
# and then divide each example by the standard deviation of the whole numpy array. But for picture datasets, 
# it is simpler and more convenient and works almost as well to just divide every row of the dataset by 255 (the maximum value of a pixel channel).

#  During the training of your model, you're going to multiply weights and add biases to some initial inputs in order to observe neuron activations. 
# Then you backpropogate with the gradients to train the model. But, it is extremely important for each feature to have a similar range such that our gradients don't explode.
#  You will see that more in detail later in the lectures. !--> 

# Let's standardize our dataset.

train_set_x = train_set_x_flatten / 255.
test_set_x = test_set_x_flatten / 255.

# **What you need to remember:**

# Common steps for pre-processing a new dataset are:
# - Figure out the dimensions and shapes of the problem (m_train, m_test, num_px, ...)
# - Reshape the datasets such that each example is now a vector of size (num_px \* num_px \* 3, 1)
# - "Standardize" the data

## 3 - General Architecture of the learning algorithm ##

# It's time to design a simple algorithm to distinguish cat images from non-cat images.

# You will build a Logistic Regression, using a Neural Network mindset. 
# The following Figure explains why **Logistic Regression is actually a very simple Neural Network!**

# **Mathematical expression of the algorithm**:

# For one example $x^{(i)}$:
# $$z^{(i)} = w^T x^{(i)} + b \tag{1}$$
# $$\hat{y}^{(i)} = a^{(i)} = sigmoid(z^{(i)})\tag{2}$$ 
# $$ \mathcal{L}(a^{(i)}, y^{(i)}) =  - y^{(i)}  \log(a^{(i)}) - (1-y^{(i)} )  \log(1-a^{(i)})\tag{3}$$

# The cost is then computed by summing over all training examples:
# $$ J = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \mathcal{L}(a^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\tag{6}$$

# **Key steps**:
# In this exercise, you will carry out the following steps: 
    # - Initialize the parameters of the model
    # - Learn the parameters for the model by minimizing the cost  
    # - Use the learned parameters to make predictions (on the test set)
    # - Analyse the results and conclude

## 4 - Building the parts of our algorithm ## 

# The main steps for building a Neural Network are:
# 1. Define the model structure (such as number of input features) 
# 2. Initialize the model's parameters
# 3. Loop:
    # - Calculate current loss (forward propagation)
    # - Calculate current gradient (backward propagation)
    # - Update parameters (gradient descent)

# You often build 1-3 separately and integrate them into one function we call `model()`.

### Exercise 3 - sigmoid
# Using your code from "Python Basics", implement `sigmoid()`. 
# As you've seen in the figure above, you need to compute $sigmoid(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$ for $z = w^T x + b$ to make predictions. 
# Use np.exp().

def sigmoid(z):
    """
    Compute the sigmoid of z

    Arguments:
    z -- A scalar or numpy array of any size.

    Return:
    s -- sigmoid(z)
    """
    s = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))
    
    return s

### Exercise 4 - initialize_with_zeros
# Implement parameter initialization in the cell below. You have to initialize w as a vector of zeros. 
# If you don't know what numpy function to use, look up np.zeros() in the Numpy library's documentation.

def initialize_with_zeros(dim):
    """
    This function creates a vector of zeros of shape (dim, 1) for w and initializes b to 0.
    
    Argument:
    dim -- size of the w vector we want (or number of parameters in this case)
    
    Returns:
    w -- initialized vector of shape (dim, 1)

    """
    
    w = np.zeros((dim,1))
    b = 0.
    
    return w, b

### 4.3 - Forward and Backward propagation

# Now that your parameters are initialized, you can do the "forward" and "backward" propagation steps for learning the parameters.

### Exercise 5 - propagate
# Implement a function `propagate()` that computes the cost function and its gradient.

# Forward Propagation:
# - You get X
# - You compute $A = \sigma(w^T X + b) = (a^{(1)}, a^{(2)}, ..., a^{(m-1)}, a^{(m)})$
# - You calculate the cost function: $J = -\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(y^{(i)}\log(a^{(i)})+(1-y^{(i)})\log(1-a^{(i)}))$

# Here are the two formulas you will be using: 

# $$ \frac{\partial J}{\partial w} = \frac{1}{m}X(A-Y)^T\tag{7}$$
# $$ \frac{\partial J}{\partial b} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m (a^{(i)}-y^{(i)})\tag{8}$$

def propagate(w, b, X, Y):
    """

    w -- weights, a numpy array of size (num_px * num_px * 3, 1)

### 4.4 - Optimization
